# React Router Practice Repository

This repository serves as a practice space for learning and experimenting with React Router, a popular routing library for React applications. 

## What is React Router?

[React Router](https://reactrouter.com/) is a powerful routing library for React applications that allows you to manage the navigation and views of your application. It helps you build single-page applications (SPAs) with dynamic, client-side routing.

Key features of React Router include:

- **Declarative Routing:** Define your application's routes in a declarative manner, making it easy to understand and maintain your application's navigation structure.

- **Nested Routing:** Create nested routes and views, enabling you to build complex user interfaces with multiple levels of routing.

- **Route Parameters:** Pass parameters and data between routes to customize and render components based on dynamic data.

- **Programmatic Navigation:** Programmatically navigate between views, making it easy to create interactive and user-friendly applications.

## Purpose of this Repository

This repository is created with the sole purpose of providing a safe and controlled environment for learning React Router. It is a practice repository, which means:

- You can experiment with different routing configurations and strategies.
- You can create and test various React components that use React Router for navigation.
- You can make mistakes, learn from them, and refine your understanding of React Router without affecting production code.

## Getting Started
